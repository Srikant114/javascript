### Data Types in JavaScript
- It simply means that to store different types of information, there are different types of data types.

- There are two major types of data types in javascript.
1. Primitive - These are the constant data types which are already been created by the Javascript engine.
2. Non Primitive - These are the data type, which can be created by the user.

#### Primitive data types are of seven types.
1. Number: Any numerical value positive negative and decimal all are stored in number type only.
2. String: Any text value will be stored under stream type. String can be created by single court, double quote and also backtick can be used.
3. Boolean: Kenneth Rowe or false value will be stored in Boolean type.
4. Undefined: Any value which is not defined is undefined. I'm the type of undefined is undefined and undefined is a keyword in javascript.
5. Null:It is an empty value, which javascript will not assign, but a user can add null value to an empty value. The type of null is an object.
6. BigInt: BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number .
7. Symbol:The JavaScript Symbol is a primitive data type, just like Number, String, Boolean, etc. It represents a unique identifier and can be used in various ways. Symbols are used to create object properties,

##### Why the type of null is Object
- Basically, it is a bug in javascript from. its early days where it is not fixed because lot of website has been created. So if it's fixed then the website would break. So that's why the null type is object is being continued.
